  FuckOFF-OS is a personal project to create a custom operating system from scratch using Assembly (ASM) and C. The primary goal of this project is to build a basic kernel that serves as a foundation for future utilities and further learning about OS internals. 

  The project currently features the following:
  
  - **Custom Kernel**: A minimalistic kernel that lays the groundwork for the operating system.
  
  - **Bootloader**: A basic bootloader to load the kernel during system startup.
  
  - **Interrupt Handling**: The kernel handles basic interrupts such as the timer interrupt for multitasking and keyboard interrupts for user input.
  
  - **IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table)**: The core interrupt handling system to manage interrupts from hardware and software sources.
  
  - **Timer Support**: Provides the foundation for time-based processes and potential multitasking in the future.
  
  **Future Features**:
  
  - **Shell**: A simple shell will be implemented in the future to provide users with a basic command-line interface for executing system commands and interacting with the OS.
  
  - **File System**: Implement a basic file system for persistent storage.
  
  - **Multitasking**: Add preemptive multitasking support for running multiple processes concurrently.
  
  - **Memory Management**: Develop a simple memory manager for allocating and freeing memory, including virtual memory support.
  
  - **Drivers**: Add device drivers to interact with hardware components such as keyboards, disks, and displays.
